Unofficial Cobalt-based YouTube modification for LG webOS TVs with ad blocking and SponsorBlock support.

> This project is unofficial and is not affiliated with YouTube, Google, LG or webOS.

## Features

- YouTube for LG webOS TVs
- Advertisement blocking
- SponsorBlock support
- Return YouTube Dislike support
- Automatic account selection on startup
- Playback speed support
- Optional Shorts visibility
- Video quality setting: Safe (1080p SDR), 4K SDR, or 4K HDR
- Optional autostart integration
- Installable `.ipk` package

The configuration screen can be opened with the **GREEN** button on the LG remote.
While a video is playing, press **1** to decrease playback speed or **3** to increase it. Press **0** to toggle subtitles.

### Video quality

Press **GREEN**, select **Video quality**, and press **OK** to cycle through:

- **Safe · 1080p SDR (default)** — H.264 up to 1080p60.
- **4K · SDR** — also enables VP9 and AV1 up to 2160p60.
- **4K · HDR** — also enables HDR10/HLG for those UHD codecs.

The selection is saved on the TV. **Fully close and reopen the app** to apply a
change; going to Home may leave the app running. Choose a mode supported by your
TV. If playback fails, switch back to Safe and restart. The menu shows the active
mode and whether a restart is pending. This requires the updated native runtime;
updating only the injected web assets cannot enable the setting on older builds.
No root access, SSH or environment-variable configuration is needed.

For developer testing, `YTAF_VIDEO_CAPS` still takes precedence over the saved
selection; the menu identifies when that override is active.

## Installation

Download the current `.ipk` from the GitHub releases page and install it using Homebrew Channel, webOS Device Manager, `ares-cli`, or the webOS app install service on rooted devices.

The package uses the original `youtube.leanback.v4` application id to preserve YouTube sign-in and phone pairing compatibility. Installing it replaces the official YouTube application.

### Homebrew Channel repository

Add the following custom repository in Homebrew Channel:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RF1705/youtube-webos-cobalt-adfree/main/repo.json
```

Do not install this package alongside another Homebrew package using the same `youtube.leanback.v4` application id.

## Building

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RF1705/youtube-webos-cobalt-adfree.git
cd youtube-webos-cobalt-adfree
```

The current Cobalt runtime is built directly for webOS and packaged without an LG Cobalt starter binary. Build helpers and platform patches are contained in `cobalt-platform/` and `scripts/`.

Relevant build scripts include:

- `scripts/build-starterless-cobalt-docker.sh` — builds Cobalt for webOS
- `scripts/package-starterless-cobalt.sh` — creates the application package
- `scripts/build-sdl-webos-docker.sh` — builds the SDL webOS platform dependency

## Development

The web application sources are in `webapp/`.

Run the webapp tests with:

```sh
cd webapp
npm install
npm test
```

## Compatibility

Compatibility depends on the webOS version, TV platform, firmware and Cobalt/Starboard runtime. Please use the issue tracker for current device reports and compatibility problems.

## License

See the repository license files for the licensing terms of the project and its components.
